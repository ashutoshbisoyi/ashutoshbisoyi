### About Me
I am an ECE undergraduate, and a Front-end web developer from Odisha, India. I have a serious passion for exploring new ideas and formatting them digitally as a website. I'm pretty familiar with developing interactive front-end websites, building single-page applications, and API integrations.

I have worked with multiple organizations and start-ups and helped them to showcase their story/services by building website that is pretty efficient and more approachable. 15+ realtime websites done till now and still upgrading to new technologies with the trend.

Besides developing web pages, I am quite passionate about dancing, anchoring, and acting.
